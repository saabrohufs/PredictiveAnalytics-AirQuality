# Predictive Analytics of Air Quality for IoT- Enabled Industrial Environments
This repository provides the implementation of Predictive Analytics of Air Quality in Industrial Environments. Air particle trends in collected data for CO2, particulate matter PM2.5, and PM10 for one-month period (during March 2024) are depicted in following figures.
